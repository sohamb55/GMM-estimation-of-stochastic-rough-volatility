The project is about GMM estimation of Rough Volatility in Multivariate Setting. The folder content highlights are are as follows:<br>
<br>
<br>
--Theory: Simulation examples of standrad Brownian Motion (BM) and fractional Brownian Motion.<br>
--Simulation: Simulation of fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process and price processes driven by BM in univariate and bivariate setting.<br>
--GMM: Estimation of parameters (uncorrected, exact and CLT approximation) for log-normal Stochastic Volatility (SV) model in univariate and bivariate setting. <br>
